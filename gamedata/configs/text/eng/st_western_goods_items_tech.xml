            The ZenBook 13 is a laptop of the ultra-portable family. Produced by ASUS, it was surely brought into the zone by mercenaries. It seems to have been slightly damaged, making it unusable. Though its components are worth a fortune, and a trader could put a pretty price on it.\n

            Black computer case with what seems to be recent parts. It's definitely not an old soviet computer left behind after the 2006' "Second Disaster". Getting access to electricity in the Zone isn't given to anyone, so it'll be hard to get it working. It could always be sold to traders, modern computer parts are a rare sight these days.\n

            Damaged Logitech keyboard. It's none of those fancy keyboards for video games, but just a simple keyboard. It seems too damaged to be used, although it's still a good source of electronic components.\n

            This seems to be an advanced military decoder. It has english inscriptions all-around, so it probably comes from outside the Zone. It's not really of any use for the everyday stalker, but traders often look for these rare devices.\n

            A really rare piece of equipment in the Zone. It seems to be a military grade GPS locator, usually used by NATO countries. It probably found its way into the Zone when the ISG was still around. It indicates the name and the distance to the nearest area. It also shows the name of the region of the Zone the user is located in. That being said, its database seems outdated. Some areas well known by stalkers are missing.\n
