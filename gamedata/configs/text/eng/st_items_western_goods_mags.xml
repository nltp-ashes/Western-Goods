			One of the last of these magazines to be printed before their switch to a digital version. Unlike soviet magazines of the same kind that are often found in the Zone, it does not look like it has been through hell and back. Besides a few missing pages, it is almost complete. It probably found its way in the Zone from mercs, they've been known to import western goods lately.\n

			Strana Igr (Russian: —трана игр, Gameland) was a Russian magazine focused on video games. It was published by Gameland between January 1996 and November 2013 when the magazine was suspended due to financial problems. It's a bit odd that such a magazine found its way into the Zone. Perhaps after western goods became more and more present in the Zone, Russian speakers grew an interest for western culture?\n

			Evo is a British automobile magazine dedicated to performance cars. These magazines are more and more commonly found in the Zone, most likely because it gives a taste of the outside world to those stuck here.\n
