### ABOUT

This addon was originally a minor addon that added a few drinks and snack from popular brands in western countries. Overtime, it evolved into a full-size game extension, adding new gameplay mechanics, consumables, readable magazines, trade items, devices, unique NPCs, and even a new set of storylines. Feel free to suggest new items or ideas in general, I'll do my best to add it if it fits the addon.
